# Problem 07

Write a C program that:
Takes the principal (P), time (T in years), and rate of interest (R in %) as input from the user.
Calculates the Simple Interest (SI) using the formula:

$Simple \ Interest = \frac{P \times T \times R}{100}$


Displays the calculated simple interest.


## Example
<b>Input<b><br>
<pre>Principal: 500
Time: 2
Rate: 5
Enter the value of b: 10</pre>
<b>Output<b><br>
<pre>Simple Interest = 500.00</pre>




Notes:
- P = Principal amount
- T = Time in years
- R = Rate of interest in percent
